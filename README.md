# DBMS-Case-Study-Project
This repository contains the final project for the database management systems course.
In this project, I was given a case study where I had to design and implement an incident response system.

All of the code was written by myself.
It is mostly SQL code. There is one instance where I embed SQL into python code
using some python libraries. I also designed the diagrams using draw.io.
